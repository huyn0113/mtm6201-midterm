                <p role="text">Anna had always dreamt of owning her own bakery. After years of working in various bakeries and honing her skills, Anna had come up with the concept of customizing your own treats tailored to your emotions. However, she was hesitant on making the commitment to start the business. She opted to take commissions from those around her. Before she knew it, she brought a small customer base! It was about a year ago that she decided to finally take on a team and start a site where we she began to take on orders.</p>
